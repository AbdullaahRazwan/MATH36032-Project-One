# MATH36032-Project-One
Code and report for coursework one of MATH36032

This coursework consisted of three problems in the area of number theory. 

The first was, given an integer N, to find a rational approximaion p/q of the Euler-Mascheroni constant with p+q<=N. This is done with the MATLAB script 'AppEM.m'. 

The second problem was to find the smallest MyLucky number greater than or equal to a given input. This was done using two functions: 'isMyLuckynum.m' - which tested if a given number was MyLucky or not - and 'MyLuckynum.m' which used the first and found the smallest MyLucky number greater than or equal to the input. 

The third task was to find the number n such that n^2 is a beautiful square and closest to 360322021. This was done with two functions 'num2dig.m', which takes a double x and returns an array consisting of the digits in x, and 'beatisqnum.m' which used the first and returned a number i such that i^2 is the beautiful square closest to 360322021. 

The pdf 'MATH36032_Coursework_One_Draft_Two(4)' discussed the problems and solutions.
